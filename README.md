4. Create an account with Flickr and apply for a non-commercial API key.
5. Create a config.js file in the project's src folder.
6. In the config file add:
```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
export default apiKey;
```
7. Run 'npm start' to view the project in your browser at:  localhost:3000

## Project objective

In this project, JSX is used to write markup-like syntax directly in the JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components. Additionally, supportive tools are used in this React project like the Create React App and React Router modules.

## Techniques and concepts

- create-react-app
- JSX
- React Router
- Fetch API
- Flickr API

## Additional features

In addition to completing the basic requirements for this techdegree project, I also added additional features including:

- [x] Displaying a loading indicator each time the app fetches new data.
- [x] Displaying a friendly user message when no matches are found by search
- [x] Display a 404 error component when a URL does not match an existing route
- [x] Personalized CSS stylings

## Code example

From the Search.js component, this function is executed when the form (search box) is submitted.

```javascript
// When form is submitted
handleSubmit = (e) => {
	e.preventDefault();
	let searchQuery = this.search.value;
	// Pass search query to performSearch function in App.js
	this.props.newSearch(searchQuery);
	e.currentTarget.reset();
	let path = `/search/${searchQuery}`;
	// Push new entry onto history stack (list of previously visited URLs)
	// which allows us to programmatically change the URL
	this.props.history.push(path);
};
```
